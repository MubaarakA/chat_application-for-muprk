 Chat Application using Sockets and Tkinter

This application is a simple, user-friendly chat system built using Pythonâ€™s socket programming and Tkinter for the graphical interface. The project consists of a server that manages client connections and multiple client interfaces that allow users to chat with one another.

 How to Use:

1. Start the Server:
   - Begin by running the server script. The server will listen for incoming client connections and manage communication between clients.

2. Run the Clients:
   - After starting the server, you can run as many client instances as you like. Each client will connect to the server and display a user interface where you can select a person to chat with.

3. Selecting a Chat Partner:
   - On the client interface, select the user you wish to chat with. Ensure that the selected user also chooses you as their chat partner. When a user selects you, a notification will appear, indicating that someone wishes to talk to you, along with their unique `fileno` (file descriptor).

4. Chatting:
   - Once both users have mutually selected each other, they can start exchanging messages. The messages are routed through the server, ensuring smooth communication between the selected chat partners.
